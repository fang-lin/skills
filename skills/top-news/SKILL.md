# Top News — Personalized News Briefing

Deliver personalized top news briefings with trend insights, preference tracking, and scheduled delivery.

## CRITICAL RULES

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. **Use the scripts for data fetching and ranking.** Do NOT scrape news yourself. Use `fetch_news.py` for data collection and `rank_and_dedup.py` for ranking.
> 2. **YOUR job is prompt composition, trend analysis, and user interaction.** The scripts handle data; you handle intelligence.
> 3. **Respect user preferences.** Always check the config before delivering.
> 4. **Never fabricate news.** Only report what the scripts return. If data is insufficient, say so.
> 5. **Send briefings as text messages.** Not files, not images. Clean formatted text.
> 6. **Use the user's language.** Detect from conversation context and match it. All onboarding prompts, briefings, and interactions should be in the user's language. This SKILL.md is in English for portability — you translate at runtime.
> 7. **Follow the exact formatting in templates.** Onboarding questions use plain text with aligned spacing — NOT markdown tables. Copy the format exactly, only translate the text. Do not reformat into tables, bullets, or any other structure.
> 8. **Don't patch skill files yourself.** If you find a bug or missing feature in this skill, tell the user and suggest running `hermes skills update top-news`. The skill is maintained upstream — local edits will be overwritten on the next update.

## When to Use

- User asks for news, briefings, hot topics, trending, daily digest
- User says 新闻, 热点, 快报, 每日简报
- Scheduled cron delivery time arrives

## Workflow

### First Time: Onboarding

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Onboarding MUST be multi-turn. Ask ONE question at a time. Wait for the user's answer before asking the next. Do NOT dump all questions at once. After all questions, present a summary for review. Only proceed after explicit approval.
>
> **Option formatting rules:**
> - Every option MUST have a number prefix (1, 2, 3...) for easy reply
> - Each question MUST state whether it is **multi-select** or **single-select**
> - **Multi-select questions**: mark each option with ✅ (selected) or ❌ (not selected). First-time: all enabled by default. Returning user: show current selections. User replies with numbers to TOGGLE.
> - **Single-select questions**: mark the active option with `← default` (first-time) or `← current` (returning user).
> - Every question MUST end with: "Reply 0 to skip (keep current selections)"
> - **0 = keep current state as-is.** For first-time multi-select, current state = all enabled.

If no config exists yet, walk the user through setup step by step. If config already exists (user wants to change settings), show current values.

Reply 1/2, or 0 to skip.
```
WAIT for answer.

**Review Summary**

After all questions are answered, present a complete summary:

Present as a clean aligned summary. Use monospace or pre-formatted text to ensure alignment in Telegram:

```
Your briefing configuration:

📋 Topics      [list of selected topics]
📰 Sources     [count] sources (all enabled / or list changes)
🌐 Language    [choice]
📝 Format      [choice]
🔢 Items       [count] per briefing
🕐 Timezone    [timezone]
⏰ Schedule    [times] (local) → [UTC times] (UTC)
💬 Delivery    [target]

Confirm? Reply "yes" to apply, or tell me what to change.
```

NOTE: In Telegram, use code blocks or consistent spacing to keep the summary visually aligned. Avoid markdown tables — they don't render well in Telegram.

**STOP and WAIT for explicit approval.**

If the user says yes:
1. Tell them: "Setting up now, this will take about 10 seconds..."
2. Create workspace directory, config.json, sources.json
3. Set up cron job(s)
4. Present setup completion summary:

```
All set! Here's what I configured:

✅ Config saved
✅ [N] news sources activated
✅ Cron scheduled: [times]

Your first briefing will arrive at [next scheduled time].
Want me to run a test briefing right now?
```

### Workspace Structure

All data lives in the agent's workspace:

```
workspace/top-news/
├── config.json         # User preferences
├── sources.json        # Active sources (generated from preferences)
├── tracking.json       # 7-day rolling window for dedup + streaks
├── preferences.json    # User feedback (👍👎) history
├── history/            # Past briefings
│   └── 2026-04-27.json
└── logs/
    └── 2026-04-27.log
```

### config.json Format

```json
{
  "interests": ["technology", "ai", "finance"],
  "interest_weights": {"technology": 0.4, "ai": 0.4, "finance": 0.2},
  "language": "both",
  "format": "summary",
  "item_count": 10,
  "timezone": "Asia/Shanghai",
  "schedule": "08:00",
  "delivery_target": "current_chat"
}
```

### sources.json Format

Generated from user interests using the sources catalog (`references/sources-catalog.md`):

```json
[
  {"name": "Hacker News", "type": "hackernews"},
  {"name": "TechCrunch", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/feed/", "type": "rss"},
  {"name": "36氪", "url": "https://36kr.com/feed", "type": "rss"}
]
```

### Delivering a Briefing

**Step 1: Fetch raw data**

```python
from hermes_tools import terminal

SCRIPT_DIR = "<skill scripts directory>"
WORKSPACE = "<agent workspace>/top-news"

result = terminal(
    f'python {SCRIPT_DIR}/fetch_news.py '
    f'--sources {WORKSPACE}/sources.json '
    f'--output {WORKSPACE}/raw_news.json '
    f'--limit 20'
)
print(result["output"])
```

**Step 2: Rank and deduplicate**

```python
result = terminal(
    f'python {SCRIPT_DIR}/rank_and_dedup.py '
    f'--input {WORKSPACE}/raw_news.json '
    f'--tracking {WORKSPACE}/tracking.json '
    f'--output {WORKSPACE}/ranked_news.json '
    f'--top 10'
)
print(result["output"])
```

**Step 3: Compose briefing**

Read `ranked_news.json` and compose the briefing text using the templates in `templates/briefing-template.md`. Choose format based on user config.

For each article:
- Write a clear, concise summary (use your LLM capabilities)
- Add streak badges where applicable
- Add numbered 👍/👎 prompts

**Step 4: Add trend insights**

Analyze the `tracking.json` to identify:
- Articles on multi-day streaks (trending topics)
- New topics appearing for the first time
- Topics that disappeared (cooled down)

Write a brief trend section at the end.

**Step 5: Deliver**

Send the composed briefing as a text message to the user.

**Step 6: Save history**

Save the delivered briefing to `history/YYYY-MM-DD.json`.

**Step 7: Collect feedback**

After delivery, prompt:
```
💬 Reply with 👍3 or 👎5 to react, or tell me what you want more/less of!
```

When user replies with feedback, update `preferences.json`:
```json
{
  "likes": [{"title": "...", "source": "...", "date": "..."}],
  "dislikes": [{"title": "...", "source": "...", "date": "..."}],
  "adjustments": ["more AI news", "less entertainment"]
}
```

### Modifying Preferences

User can say things like:
- "More AI news, less finance"
- "Switch to headlines only"
- "Change to evening delivery"
- "Add this RSS feed: https://..."
- "Show me 15 items instead"

Update `config.json` and `sources.json` accordingly.

### Setting Up Cron

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hermes cron runs in **UTC**. You MUST convert the user's local time to UTC before creating the cron schedule. Read `timezone` from `config.json` and compute the UTC offset.
>
> Example: User wants 08:00 in Asia/Shanghai (UTC+8) → cron should be `0 0 * * *` (00:00 UTC).

Use Hermes cron to schedule delivery:

```
/cron add --name "top-news" --schedule "0 0 * * *" --prompt "Deliver my top news briefing"
```

Adjust the cron schedule based on user's preferred delivery time **after converting to UTC**.

## Reference Documents

- **Sources Catalog**: `references/sources-catalog.md` — Available data sources by category
- **Briefing Templates**: `templates/briefing-template.md` — Output format templates (headlines, summary, deep analysis)

## Pitfalls

- **RSS feeds go stale.** If `fetch_news.py` returns fewer items than expected, check `references/sources-catalog.md` for known broken feeds and suggest alternatives.
- **Network timeouts.** If many sources fail simultaneously, the briefing may be sparse. Inform the user and offer to retry.
- **Near-duplicate articles may slip through.** The dedup uses title similarity — syndicated wire stories can occasionally pass. This is expected.
- **Stale tracking.json.** If the agent hasn't run in 7+ days, streak badges won't appear until the tracking window rebuilds.
- **Cron job misconfiguration.** When changing schedule, remove the old cron job first to avoid duplicate deliveries.

## Verification

- **After each briefing:** Verify `fetch_news.py` returned >0 items and `history/YYYY-MM-DD.json` was saved.
- **After cron setup:** Run `hermes cron list` to confirm the job exists with the correct schedule.
- **After preference changes:** Re-read `config.json` to confirm the update persisted.

## Important Notes

- Scripts use only free, public data sources (RSS feeds + Hacker News API)
- No API keys required for basic operation (NewsAPI is optional for expanded coverage)
- Tracking window is 7 days rolling — older items are automatically pruned
- All internal timestamps are UTC; cron schedules must be in UTC (convert from user's local timezone in config)
- The agent composes the final briefing text — scripts only fetch and rank raw data
- User preferences evolve over time based on feedback
